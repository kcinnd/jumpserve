        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mastermind! Your goal is to guess the secret code of five volleyballs Here's how:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The secret code consists of 5 volleyballs, each possibly one of 10 colors.</li>
            <li>Each guess must also consist of 5 volleyballs</li>
            <li>After each guess, you'll receive feedback in the form of black and white pegs:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>black peg</strong> indicates a volleyball of the right color in the correct position.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>white peg</strong> indicates a volleyball of the right color but in the wrong position.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You have 8 chances to guess the code correctly.</li>
            <li>To make a guess, select colors from the options at the bottom and place them in the blank spots on the current row. Then, press "Submit Guess".</li>
            <li>If all volleyballs in a guess are correct in both color and position, you win!</li>
            <li>If you use all 8 guesses without solving the code, the game resets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>
